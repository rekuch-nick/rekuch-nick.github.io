			There are 10 kinds of secret rooms hidden in the maze. Some of them hold Power Orbs, some of them hold other
			treasures. Knowing how to find each one, and what it holds, is critical to your success!

			<br>
			Each one can only be reached by stepping though a portal, but where are those portals hidden?

		<div id="doorSpike" class="doorImage">
			Look for a spike trap that doesn't hurt to walk over. Blow it up with a bomb to reach the Spike Pit, which
			holds a Power Orb.
		</div>
		<div id="doorWater" class="doorImage">
			If you beat enough water monsters, a portal will appear. Deep underwater you may find a Power Orb. 
		</div>
		<div id="doorGrass" class="doorImage">
			Look for some strange looking grass. Blow it up with a bomb to find the Bug Field, which holds the
			Legend Helm.
		</div>
		<div id="doorIce" class="doorImage">
			Look for an odd patch of ice. Blow it up with a bomb to find the Frozen Field, which holds
			the Legend Cloak.
		</div>
		<div id="doorTree" class="doorImage">
			A powerful Ent blocks the way. Beat it to find the Dark Woods, which holds the Improved Potion.
		</div>
		<div id="doorIron" class="doorImage">
			Look for a strange block you can walk through. Blow it up with a bomb to reach the Iron Maze, which
			holds a Power Orb.
		</div>
		<div id="doorSwitch" class="doorImage">
			Look for a switch that looks odd after you press it. Blow it up with a bomb to reach the Control Room
			which holds a Power Orb.
		</div>
		<div id="doorSwamp" class="doorImage">
			Beat enough swamp monsters and you'll be able to reach the Slime Pit, which holds the
			Legend Belt.
		</div>
		<div id="doorFire" class="doorImage">
			Survive for long enough in a burning room and the doorway to the Furnace will open. Inside are
			10 keys.
		</div>
		<div id="doorLava" class="doorImage">
			Find one of these lava monsters and beat it to open a portal. Deep below the lava you will find
			a Power Orb.
