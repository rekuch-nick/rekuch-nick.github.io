			After each run you'll count your winnings and possibly receive new UPGRADE POINTS. 
			Spend these on various special powers each run to improve your chances.
			You can reallocate these every run, so don't worry about wasting them.
			Try all kinds of combinations!
			<br><br>
			Since all the upgrades don't appear until you've played for a while, you might want to be surprised by them.
			If you're sure you are ready to see the descriptions you can click on any of the upgrades below:

		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>

		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Storm Caller
			</summary>
				Begin the run already knowing the Bolt spell (Book 1) and with 4 bonus MP. <br>
				(The 4 bonus MP is 4 fewer MP Books you'll encounter- 
				this perk means you'll need to find 5 less books to know every spell.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Key Keeper
			</summary>
				Opening a door will not consume a key. You still need to have one. <br>
				(Opening a treasure chest will still consume a key.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Coal Walker
			</summary>
				Take half damage from fire, and one third damage from lava.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Caster's Kit
			</summary>
				Start with a +2 Cape of Power that grants bonus MP, and
				a Staff of the Magi, that lets you cast all 6 of the basic spells. <br>
				(If you replace the staff you'll lose any spells you haven't read the book for.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Collector
			</summary>
				Each time you equip a new piece of gear, you'll permanently gain +3 HP. 
				You're also 20% more likely to find power bombs.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Quick Draw
			</summary>
				Each time you enter a new room you will gain first-strike and power attack buffs as if you had cast Blur 2 and Might 2.

		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Dare Devil
			</summary>
				If you manage to find and beat a Guardian Monster while still level 1 you'll 
				instantly gain 8 levels, 500 gold, and your team favor will be set to 100. <br>
				(This perk is good for rushing though the early parts of the game after you already have a lot of upgrades.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Bushwacker
			</summary>
				Walking through tall grass will no longer stir up bugs.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				King's Legacy
			</summary>
				Begin the run with +4 Midas Fist, 
				an item that makes monster drop coins when you beat them. <br>
				(This perk lets you play more like a typical RPG where you fight monsters to level up.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				MP Pincher
			</summary>
				All of your spells cost 2 less MP.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Treasure Hunter
			</summary>
				One more treasure will be placed on each floor.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Beastly
			</summary>
				Gain +20 HP. <br>
				(While this eventually gives less total HP than Hardy, if gives them all right away. Of course, you
				could always use both for maximum HP.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Orb Drinker
			</summary>
				Level up each time you collect a Power Orb. <br>
				(While the first 10 or so levels can come fairly quickly, you quickly need more and more XP to 
				level up. The highest levels around 20 can (practically) only be reached with this perk.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Stealthy
			</summary>
				Gain +1 Stealth.
				(Stealth is the number of steps you can take before a new monster appears.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Eldritch T.V. Star
			</summary>
				Gain Regen stacks every time you enter a new room equal to that room's number. <br>
				Every 15th floor will have a valuable Gem worth 25 + (room number * 1.2) gold. <br>
				Each gem you pick up gives you +12 HP, 6 MP, 2 Atk, and 2 Perception.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Orbless
			</summary>
				Begin the run with zero Orbs, no matter how many you've already found. <br>
				Beating the game with this perk is the ultimate challenge! <br>
				(It is also the best way to make use of the Orb Drinker Perk and Ghost Armor.)
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>
				Collector Specter
			</summary>
				When you equip a piece of gear in each slot a dangerous ghost will appear to block your progress. <br>
				If you beat the ghost it will drop a special armor than improves in power each time you pick up an orb.
