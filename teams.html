			Once you unlock Team Registration Boards, you'll encounter one in most rooms. 
			You can use a team's board to sign up for that team. 
			<br><br>
			Each team will grant and deduct favor points for different actions, 
			and you can spend favor points at that team's board to use that team's special powers.
			<br><br>
			Once you're a member of a particular team, there's a 50% chance each team board you encounter will
			belong to your team, and a 50% chance it'll belong to one of the other 3 teams. 
			<br><br>
			You can change teams any time you find a different team's board, but you'll lose half of your favor 
			points each time you do.
