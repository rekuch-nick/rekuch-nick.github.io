			Troll TV is the hottest game show in the nation. Contestents come from far and wide to compete for
			fabulous cash prizes. 
			<br><br>
			Troll TV isn't a quiz show, it doesn't ask you to guess how much a toaster costs, and there's no prize wheel
			to spin. Troll TV takes regular people just like you and drops them in a giant maze filled with traps, monsters,
			gold coins, swords, armor, bombs, spikes, and fire!
			<br><br>
			Any contestant able to navigate 101 floors of brutal exploration and combat will win our grand prize of 23 
			million dollars and a lifetime supply of ramen noodles!
			<br><br>
			But don't think it'll be easy- hidden in the maze are 7 power orbs protected by powerful guardians.
			There's no way to enter the final room without all of them. In fact they're so hard to find that we
			let returning contestants keep them for the next try- you'd have to be some kind of a hero to get all
			7 in one run.
			<br><br>
			To make things even harder, we count 10 slow mississippis after the show begins before letting out the 
			terrible troll. His perfect sense of smell and unstoppable hunger will lead him directly to the contestant.
			So before you spend too long in any one room, remember what's hunting you...
			<br><br>
			Do you think you have what it takes to win fame and wealth on our show? Mail yourself in a self-addressed stamped
			envlope to 555 Pine street, Lower Abyss Tartarus, 47130 today!
